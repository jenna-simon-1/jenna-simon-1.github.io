## Using Canva to illustrate COVID-19 trends

As many universities changed to a hybrid or completely online mode of instruction this semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased number of students opted to take a semester off or defer their enrollment. The infographic below shows how this trend affected different types of universities differently, and how international were more likely to change their enrollment status based on universties' changes in instruction mode. Data provided by the [National Student Clearinghouse Research Center](https://nscresearchcenter.org/stay-informed/).

## Using TimelineJS 

#### <em>History of "The Rivalry"</em>

The Rivalry football game between Lehigh University and Lafayette College has an over 100-year history. In the visualization below, I used TimelineJS to showcase some of the highlights of the rivalry since it began in 1884.

#### <em>History of Pandemics</em>

Diseases have been a threat to populations since the beginning of humanity. However, as civilizations have developed, the threat of the spread of these diseases has become more significant. Larger cities, increased international trade, and increased contact with people from throughout the world can all contribute to faster and wider spread of illness.

As reported by [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/), the frequency of infectious disease outbreaks has increased in the modern era. The timeline below highlights some of the most significant infectious disease outbreaks in history, dating back to 165 AD.
