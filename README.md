## Using Canva to illustrate COVID-19 trends

As many universities changed to a hybrid or completely online mode of instruction this semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased number of students opted to take a semester off or defer their enrollment. The infographic below shows how this trend affected different types of universities differently, and how international students were more likely to change their enrollment status based on universties' changes in instruction mode. Data provided by the [National Student Clearinghouse Research Center](https://nscresearchcenter.org/stay-informed/).

### <em>History of Pandemics</em>

Diseases have been a threat to populations since the beginning of humanity. However, as civilizations have developed, the threat of the spread of these diseases has become more significant. Larger cities, increased international trade, and increased contact with people from throughout the world can all contribute to faster and wider spread of illness.

As reported by [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/), the frequency of infectious disease outbreaks has increased in the modern era. The timeline below highlights some of the most significant infectious disease outbreaks in history, dating back to 165 AD, according to data in the linked Visual Capitalist article above.

### <em>COVID-19 Testing Sources for Lehigh Students</em>

Lehigh University began surveillance testing of its students for COVID-19 the week of 10/05/2020. Up until that point, the Lehigh University Health and Wellness Center (HWC) had only tested symptomatic students.

In the days leading up to the start of surveillance testing, there was spike in the number of on-campus symptomatic cases. Many students were told they would have to wait days to be tested, as the university could not keep up with the sudden increase in demand for testing. Therefore, many students sought alternatives to testing from the university.

The following graphic shows the breakdown of where Lehigh University students who tested positive for COVID-19 received their tests. As of 10/11/2020, approximately one-third of positive student tests were not adiministered by the university, according to data from the [Lehigh University COVID Dashboard](https://coronavirus.lehigh.edu/covid-19-dashboard-reporting) on that date.

## Using Google My Maps

At the start of the pandemic, testing was a difficult bottleneck to overcome in terms of taking control of the virus's spread. Many US citizens were highly critical of the government's ability to role out testing early on. This map shows the top 20 countries in terms of tests performed per day per 100,000 people, based on a 7-day moving average starting 10/19/2020.

This map illustrates the serious impact the COVID-19 virus has had world-wide. The countries with the highest testing rates are not concentrated in any one geographic area. As opposed to other viruses that may have had more serious impacts in some parts of the world when compared to others, COVID-19 has spurred significant response protocols, such as high testing rates, in countries all around the globe.

## Using Tableau

### <em>Party Data</em>
A survey of Lehigh University students was conducted to see what students' party preferences were. The graphic below examines whether students prefer attending parties off campus, or on campus. In addition to party location, the poll asked students about other party related topics such as safety and means of transportation.

Based on the survey data, male students seemed more inclined to prefer hosting parties at on-campus fraternity houses, while female students preferred attending parties off campus. When breaking down the data by campus involvement, athletes were more inclined to prefer parties hosted at off-campus houses, while students involved in Greek life showed a slight preference for attending parties at on-campus fraternity houses.

### <em>COVID-19 Cases by State</em>

When trying to judge how a state is able to control the spread of COVID-19, often looking at case numbers isn't an accurate measure. The two visualizations below demonstrate how case numbers alone can be misleading.

In the map, the color of each state represents the total number of new cases the state reported in the past seven days, as of 11/10/2020. This data is from [the CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days). The darker the blue, the more cases the state reported. To get a more defined look at these numbers, a user can choose to adjust the "Min Number of Cases" parameter using the slider at the top right. After adjusting this, the map will only highlight states that have experienced more new cases in the past seven days than this minimum number.

However, it is generally agreed that control of the virus is better illustrated by a state's testing positivity rate. In general, a positivity rate of less than 5% is seen as desirable. The visualization below the map is a representation of each state's positivity rates on 11/10/2020. This data is from [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity). Circles in red represent states that are above that 5% threshold, while circles in blue represent states that are below that threshold. The larger the circle, the higher the positivity rate. Similar to the map graphic, a user can choose to exclude circles that are below a certain positivity rate by adjusting the "Min Positivity Rate" slider.

If one were to only look at the new case numbers shown in the map, it would be easy to conclue Illinois and Texas are in the worst shape. In reality, this is not as accurate when taking into account each state's population. When looking at the circle visualization, it is easier to determine which states are experiencing the larger rates of positive cases.

## Mapping Twitter Data with ArcGIS

The heat map below shows the locations of 500 recent tweets relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. This map illustrates how the pandemic is truly a nation-wide issue, and based on tweet locations there isn't much evidence that the pandemic is central in any one location. The tweets seem to be appropriately spread out based on the country's population densities.
